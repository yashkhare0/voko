# Architecture: Core ↔ Adapters

Core responsibilities (see [PRD.md](mdc:PRD.md)):

- Config load/validate, manifest read/write/reconcile
- Locale IO, reports, diff printing, patch application
- CI `check` logic

Adapter responsibilities:

- Detect project, list files, namespace mapping, client/server classification
- Extract candidates (IR) and propose Patch plan for injection

Stability:

- `FrameworkAdapter` interface is the contract; avoid leaking adapter specifics into core.
- Keep shadcn coverage declarative in adapter.
