# Conventions: Commits, Releases, Branching

Commits (Conventional Commits; enforced by commitlint):

- Format: `type(scope)!: summary` (scope examples: core, adapter-react-next, adapter-vue-nuxt, cli)
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert
- Breaking: add `!` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer

Changesets:

- Add changeset with `pnpm changeset` per logical change; select packages and bump
- Publish flow is handled via CI; local testing uses `pnpm -r build`

Branches:

- Feature branches: `feat/<area>-<slug>`
- Fix branches: `fix/<area>-<slug>`
