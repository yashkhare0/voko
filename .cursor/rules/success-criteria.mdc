# Project Success Criteria: README is Source of Truth

The root [README.md](mdc:README.md) is the final acceptance criterion for this project. All user-facing behavior MUST match the README exactly.

## Enforcement

- Treat README as the product contract for developers adopting Voko.
- A change is “done” only if README is accurate, complete, and copy‑pasteable.
- If a PR changes behavior (CLI, config, outputs, namespacing, rich text rules, client/server rules), update README in the same PR.

## Required README Sections to Keep Accurate

- Quick Start (install, core flow: init → scan → extract → inject)
- Configuration (full field reference and example JSON)
- Namespacing (route → namespace mapping rules)
- Rich Text rules (placeholder mapping and example)
- Client vs Server behavior (Next.js guidelines)
- CLI Reference (commands, flags, exit outcomes)
- Working Files & Outputs (manifest, reports, locales)
- Best Practices & Troubleshooting
- CI Integration snippet

## PR Checklist (Blockers)

- README parity: all changed behaviors are documented.
- Examples compile logically and commands run as written.
- Config examples reflect current schema and defaults.

## Agent Guidance

- When evaluating completion or proposing changes, compare against [README.md](mdc:README.md) first.
- Prefer aligning code to README; if README is wrong, update README and code together.
