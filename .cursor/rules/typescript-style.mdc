# TypeScript Style & Safety

- Enable strict mode (already set in [tsconfig.base.json](mdc:tsconfig.base.json)).
- Prefer explicit return types for exported functions.
- Avoid `any`; use union/intersection and generics instead.
- Use early returns; avoid deep nesting.
- Keep variable names descriptive; avoid 1-2 character names.
- Organize code by feature: `src/{config,fs,hash,locale,manifest,report,inject,patch}` in core.
- Only catch errors when you can handle them meaningfully.
